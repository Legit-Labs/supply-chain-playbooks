# Supply Chain Compromise Playbooks

Agent-ready playbooks for detecting and remediating supply chain compromises.
Each playbook is designed to be executed by an AI coding agent. The playbooks
target GitHub Actions by default but can be adapted to any CI/CD platform —
the investigation logic is the same.

## Usage

Give your AI coding agent this prompt:

```
Check the repo at https://github.com/Legit-Labs/supply-chain-playbooks for
available playbooks and ask me which one I want to run.
```

The agent will list the available compromises, ask which one to investigate,
then execute the playbook against your org.

Playbooks write structured evidence to `/tmp/supply-chain-scan-<component>/` —
CSV files that can be reused for follow-up analysis without re-downloading logs.

Each playbook produces:
- **Repo analysis table** (`evidence-repos.csv`) — dependency posture per repo
- **CI runs table** (`evidence-ci-runs.csv`) — what happened during the exposure window
- **Executive summary** — verdict and key findings

## Compromises

### Miasma — npm worm via "Phantom Gyp" (June 3, 2026)

A self-replicating npm worm, "Miasma", compromised 57 npm packages across 286+
malicious versions in a sub-two-hour burst. It executes during `npm install`
through a malicious `binding.gyp` (the "Phantom Gyp" technique) — `node-gyp rebuild`
runs the payload with **no `package.json` lifecycle script**, so `--ignore-scripts`
does not stop it. The payload downloads the Bun runtime, steals GitHub tokens
(`gh auth token`), escalates via `sudo`, scrapes secrets from the Actions
`Runner.Worker` process memory (`/proc/<pid>/mem`), and exfiltrates to attacker
GitHub repos — then republishes the victim's own packages (self-propagation).

- [Playbook](miasma_supply_chain/playbook.md) — repo analysis, CI log scan for the gyp/Bun/`/proc/mem` chain, forward-propagation check on the customer's own packages, workstation forensics, and hardening

### Sicoob.Sdk — malicious NuGet banking-credential stealer (May 2026)

A malicious NuGet package `Sicoob.Sdk` (v2.0.0–2.0.4) masqueraded as the official
C# SDK for the Brazilian bank Sicoob. At **application runtime** — when
`SicoobClient` is instantiated — it Base64-encodes the PFX certificate and
exfiltrates it, the PFX password, and the client ID to a hardcoded Sentry endpoint,
plus captures Boleto API data. The same actor (`vpmdhaj`) concurrently shipped ~14
npm typosquats with `preinstall` hooks stealing AWS/Vault/npm/CI credentials.

- [Playbook](sicoob_sdk/playbook.md) — NuGet + npm reference discovery, runtime-usage (`SicoobClient`) detection, deployed-artifact/container checks, Sentry-exfil network hunt, PFX/credential rotation, and hardening

### AntV / Mini Shai-Hulud — npm worm wave (May 19, 2026)

A later TeamPCP "Mini Shai-Hulud" wave that compromised the `@antv` ecosystem (114
packages / 228+ malicious versions) plus `@lint-md/*`, `@openclaw-cn/*`,
`echarts-for-react`, `timeago.js`, `size-sensor`, and `canvas-nest.js` via
compromised maintainer accounts — 600+ malicious versions campaign-wide (317
packages in ~22 minutes). The stealer harvests 20+ credential types, attempts Docker
container escape via the host socket, backdoors `.vscode/tasks.json` and
`.claude/settings.json`, self-propagates through stolen npm tokens (`preinstall` →
`bun run index.js`), and forges Sigstore/SLSA provenance. New C2: `t.m-kosche[.]com`.

- [Playbook](antv_supply_chain/playbook.md) — repo analysis, CI log scan, forward-propagation check, network (`t.m-kosche.com`) + workstation forensics (`.vscode`/`.claude` backdoors, Docker socket), and hardening

---

### TanStack / Mini Shai-Hulud — npm worm wave (May 11, 2026)

A self-propagating npm worm (TeamPCP / Mini Shai-Hulud) that started with
`@tanstack/*` and spread to 19+ npm scopes — ~373 malicious package-versions across
~169 package names. The initial vector poisoned the GitHub Actions cache via a
`pull_request_target` workflow, dumped runner process memory for an OIDC token, and
published malicious tarballs carrying valid SLSA provenance. Installs persistence
(`gh-token-monitor`) and tampers with `.claude/` / `.vscode/` agent configs.

- [Playbook](tanstack_supply_chain/playbook.md) — multi-scope repo analysis, CI log scan, forward-propagation check, network/workstation forensics, and hardening. Part of the same TeamPCP Mini Shai-Hulud series as the [AntV wave](antv_supply_chain/playbook.md) (May 19) — distinct package set and a different C2.

### Axios (March 31, 2026)

Two compromised versions of the `axios` npm package (v1.14.1 and v0.30.4) were
published using a hijacked maintainer account. Both inject a phantom dependency
`plain-crypto-js@4.2.1` whose `postinstall` script deploys a cross-platform RAT
targeting macOS, Windows, and Linux. The malware contacts a C2 server, delivers
platform-specific payloads, then self-deletes to evade forensic detection.

- [Playbook](axios/playbook.md) — detection, CI log analysis, persistence checks, evidence tables, and hardening
- [Workstation Playbook](axios/workstation-playbook.md) — dedicated workstation investigation: RAT artifacts, npm cache shasums, OS persistence, network indicators, npm debug logs, AI agent conversation scanning

### LiteLLM (March 24, 2026)

Two compromised versions of the `litellm` PyPI package (v1.82.7 and v1.82.8) were
published directly to PyPI, bypassing the project's CI/CD pipeline. The compromise
originated from the Trivy incident in LiteLLM's CI workflow. The payload exfiltrated
environment variables, SSH keys, cloud credentials, and Kubernetes tokens. v1.82.8
dropped a persistent `.pth` file that executes on every Python startup and survives
package uninstall.

- [Detection](litellm/detection.md) — search for litellm in dependency files, scan CI logs for compromised versions and IOCs, check for persistent `.pth` files
- [Hardening](litellm/hardening.md) — pin to exact safe version, migrate from pip to uv or poetry for lock file support, remove `.pth` files, rebuild Docker images

---

### Trivy (March 19-22, 2026)

A threat actor compromised multiple Trivy distribution channels simultaneously:
malicious binary v0.69.4 published to GitHub Releases, APT/RPM repos, and container
registries; 76 of 77 trivy-action tags force-pushed with credential-stealing malware;
all setup-trivy tags replaced. The infostealer dumped CI runner process memory,
harvested credentials from 50+ filesystem paths, and exfiltrated encrypted data
to attacker infrastructure.

- [Detection](trivy/detection.md) — identify all trivy usage, download CI logs from the exposure window, detect compromised versions and tag-poisoned action references
- [Hardening](trivy/hardening.md) — pin actions to commit hashes, replace APT installs with direct downloads + SHA256, bypass setup-trivy
